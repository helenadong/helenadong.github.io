              This year, the world of Coachella called upon a global AR collaboration with fourteen creators. 
              <br><br>
              <em>Third Contact in NYC</em> was developed specifically for New York, as one of the five immersive, location-based AR installations for the Coachellaverse campaign, featuring Spark AR's geo-anchor (beta) capability. The remaining activations from this series are interspersed across LA, London, Tokyo and Rio. 
              <br><br>
              As a site-specifc installation, the experience reveals itself only when you're physically present at one of the designated landmarks. For New York, these location include Times Square, Central Park and Little Island. Inevitably, site-specificity grounds the experience in the context of its environment, and in turn allows the environment to acquire new levels of significance. For <em>Third Contact in NYC</em>, the underlying intention was to reinforce our appreciation for tangible space through the instilment of serenity.

             In addition to geo-anchoring, this effect also makes use of time-reactivity, allowing the hero objects to tonally transform throughout the day.
