              Following a two-year hiatus, Coachella welcomed fans back in 2022 via “Coachellaverse,” a virtual gateway featuring five location-based AR activations across major cities: New York, LA, London, Tokyo, and Rio.
              <br><br>
              In collaboration with Coachella and Meta, I developed Third Contact, an AR experience designed to extend the festival’s magic to New York.
              <br><br>
              By localizing the experience on GPS coordinates, using Meta Spark’s geo-anchor capability, the AR elements were activated when users reached specific landmarks in New York, including Times Square, Central Park, and Little Island, grounding the experience in the context of real environments.
              <br><br>
              As creative technologist, my role involved researching, concepting, designing and programming this AR experience, which encompassed the development of materials and procedural animations. I additionally conducted on-site calibration to ensure accuracy of spawn location.

              Inspired by Coachella’s iconic astronaut sculpture (c.2014) and the transitory nature of the sky, Third Contact featured a dynamic shader that made the astronaut appear as if it was falling in and out of focus, akin to interstellar dust. This ethereal motion, combined with time-reactive tonal shifts, aimed to evoke a sense of wonder while creating a moment in AR that celebrated the return of the festival.
