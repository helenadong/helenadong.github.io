              <em>Holoflux's Rift</em></a> was the AR extension of Holoflux, a physical installation that stood as the key landmark for Coachella 2023 in Indio, California.
              <br><br>
              This multifaceted installation was conceived by cyberphysical architect Güvenç Özel, whom I collaborated with closely along with the Coachella team to create a mobile-centric, target-tracked AR experience that mirrored the temporal rhythm of the physical piece, shifting throughout the day.
              <br><br>
              <em>Holoflux's Rift</em></a> was designed to begin each day with an opalescent base, then subsequently morphing into luminous wireframes by the evening. Every day, the hour of sunset served as an inflection point that dissolved the chrome metaballs and instigated a flux of color-changing particles. These particles synchronized with the night-time projections and enveloped the physical structure to ignite a symphony of light and movement, inviting festival-goers to explore its ever-evolving form until the dawn of a new day.

              As creative technologist, my role was centered on translating Güvenç’s concept into a viable AR experience, which involved technical research and prototyping, 3D procedural animations, creation of adaptive materials, and utilizing a blend of traditional and visual scripting techniques to extend the structure into virtual space.
              <br><br>
              To enable a site-specific experience, <em>Holoflux's Rift</em></a> utilized a combination of target-tracking and multiplane-tracking. This ensured a unified integration of the physical and virtual components.
